# Chatham Talks

Title: `Big Picture Feedback, No Names Needed`

Safe spaces empower people to share new and diverse feedback. In a recent experiment, I had a series of face to face talks with team members, where their words would remain nameless. By paying attention to the details, a bigger picture emerged.

**WHY IT MATTERS**

- Feedback can easily be misunderstood. The same words, when written by a colleague, and read by you, can be interpreted differently. A quick conversation would be more than enough to clarify the original intent.
- Traditional structures to capture feedback have their limitations. Anonymous written feedback is difficult to clarify. Face-to-face conversations are often hindered by unease and concerns about accountability.
- I saw the need for a middle ground, which yielded more insights than usual, with the ability to clarify. During this experiment, where the nameless conversations were flowing, feedback became rich, and free. Then, with enough input, I was able to:
    - Focus on the most impactful comments targeted at me;
    - Identify what input is meant for others, and even the team itself.

**THE FULL STORY**

During a recent shift in my career, I went after as much feedback as possible. But a feedback round had just passed, so I shook things up, by giving them this prompt: “*Share feedback - yours or others’ - anonymously, without revealing which is which.*” (inspired by the **Chatham House Rule**). I nicknamed them **Chatham Talks**.

The team expressed that these talks were an interesting idea. It gave them an opportunity to share feedback freely. And I committed to attentively listen, take notes, and only then ask questions. The questions followed two core principles:

1. Questions are meant to clarify a piece of feedback I received during our talk;
2. They do not hold the other person accountable for the feedback being given (as a way to ensure the spirit of the **Chatham House Rule**)

As the talks progressed, I refined questions, allowing given feedback to evolve into actionable items. The talks naturally became meaningful and valuable exchanges.

- Some thought of these talks as a liberating experience
- Others took the time to say everything left unsaid
- There was a time and place to laugh about misunderstandings
- And hard truths were discussed (as valuable feedback should promote)

The original concept for this experiment had a clear objective. **To get as much raw feedback as possible**. From the first talk, I got so much more. And I was also asked to return feedback. It only felt right to match their willingness, dedication and preparation, into actionable points the team could take back. And unsurprisingly, the team (through their manager) received my suggestions (and suggested I write down these ideas).

**THE TAKE AWAY**

Feedback is priceless. Finding innovative ways to promote sharing feedback is worth the struggle.
