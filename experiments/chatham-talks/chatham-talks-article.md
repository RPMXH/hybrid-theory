# Big Picture Feedback, No Names Needed

Safe spaces empower people to share new and diverse feedback. In a recent experiment, I had a series of face-to-face talks with team members, where their words would remain nameless. By paying attention to the details, a bigger picture emerged.

**WHY IT MATTERS**

- Written feedback often lacks context, while direct conversations can be limited by social discomfort and accountability concerns.
- I saw the need for a hybrid approach - anonymous but interactive - which yielded significant insights, while preserving the ability to clarify. Through this experiment, feedback became richer. And with enough input, I was able to:
  - Act on the most impactful comments aimed at me; 
  - Identify input meant for others, and even the team itself.

**THE FULL STORY**

During a recent shift in my career, I went after as much feedback as possible. But a feedback round had just passed, so I shook things up, by giving them this prompt: <ins>*“Share your feedback, or feedback you have heard from others, without revealing the source.*”</ins>  - inspired by the **Chatham House Rule**. I nicknamed them **Chatham Talks**.

The team expressed that these talks were an interesting idea. It gave them an opportunity to share feedback freely. And I committed to attentively listen, take notes, and only then ask questions. The questions followed two core principles:

1. Questions are meant to clarify a piece of feedback I received during our talk;
2. They do not hold the other person accountable for the feedback being given (to ensure the spirit of the **Chatham House Rule**)

As the talks progressed, I refined questions, allowing given feedback to evolve into actionable items. The talks naturally became meaningful and valuable exchanges.

- Some thought of these talks as a liberating experience
- Others took the time to say everything left unsaid
- There was a time and place to laugh about misunderstandings
- And hard truths were discussed - as all valuable feedback should promote

The original concept for this experiment had a clear objective. **To get as much raw feedback as possible**. From the first talk, I got so much more. And I was also asked to return feedback. It only felt right to match their willingness, dedication and preparation, into actionable points the team could take back. And unsurprisingly, the team (through their manager) received my suggestions (and suggested I write down these ideas).

**THE TAKE AWAY**

Feedback is priceless. Finding different ways to promote sharing opinions will enrich the process and contribute to the shared vision teams need to improve.
